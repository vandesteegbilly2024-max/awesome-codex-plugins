# Recipes

End-to-end examples for common product shapes. Each one shows the MCP tool calls to make, in order, and notes the gotchas to watch for.

These are sketches, not copy-paste configs — the exact JSON shapes are best discovered via `get_build_instructions` and `get_platform_documentation` once you're connected to the MCP server. Use the recipe as a roadmap.

## Recipe 1: Slack support agent

**Shape**: A Slack bot that answers questions in a channel, looks up customer info from a CRM via API, and creates tickets in Linear when it can't answer.

**Steps:**

1. **Tools**:
   - `create_tool` for `lookup_customer` (HTTP call to the CRM with `{{secret:CRM_API_KEY}}` in the header).
   - `create_tool` for `create_linear_issue` (Linear API call).
2. **Secrets**:
   - `create_secret` for `CRM_API_KEY` and `LINEAR_API_KEY`.
3. **Agent**:
   - `create_agent` with:
     - `systemPrompt`: support persona + "Responding in Slack. Be concise (under 4000 chars). Use mrkdwn (`*bold*`, `_italic_`). Strip reasoning traces."
     - `tools`: `[lookup_customer, create_linear_issue]`
     - `maxToolCalls`: 5 (enough for lookup → optional ticket creation → answer; bump if it commonly needs more)
4. **Product**:
   - `create_product` to group it all.
   - `add_product_capability` to attach the agent to the product.
5. **Surface**:
   - `create_surface` of type `slack`.
   - `install_slack_integration` (preferred over manually setting surface keys) — pass the bot token and signing secret. This does the OAuth bookkeeping.
   - `add_surface_item` to wire the capability to the Slack surface.
6. **Test**:
   - `execute_agent` directly with a test message before sending Slack traffic.
   - Then send a test message in Slack and check `trace_conversation` for the resulting conversation.

**Gotchas:**
- The Slack surface's `executionHint` may already be applied by the platform; don't double up the formatting instructions in the system prompt.
- Bot token rotation: when the Slack admin rotates the bot token, re-run `install_slack_integration`.
- `update_agent` is wholesale replacement — when iterating on the system prompt, pass the full agent config every time.

## Recipe 2: Webhook-triggered email processor

**Shape**: A Twilio webhook fires on inbound SMS, returns an empty TwiML 200 immediately, and async-processes the message: classifies it, looks up the sender's customer record, and either auto-replies via Twilio or creates a ticket.

**Steps:**

1. **Tools**:
   - `create_tool` for `send_sms_reply` (Twilio API call).
   - Reuse `lookup_customer` and `create_linear_issue` from Recipe 1.
2. **Flow**: `create_flow`:
   - Step 1: `prompt` — classify message intent (JSON output).
   - Step 2: `conditional` — branch on intent:
     - **Faq**: `prompt` to draft a reply, then `tool-call` to `send_sms_reply`.
     - **Lookup**: `tool-call` `lookup_customer` → `prompt` with customer context → `tool-call` `send_sms_reply`.
     - **Escalate**: `tool-call` `create_linear_issue` → `tool-call` `send_sms_reply` ("Got it, a human will follow up").
3. **Surface**: `create_surface` of type `webhook`:
   - `behavior.response`: empty TwiML — `<?xml version="1.0"?><Response></Response>` — so Twilio gets a valid ACK shape.
   - Setting `behavior.response` makes the flow fire **async**, which is what we want.
4. **Wiring**: `add_product_capability` + `add_surface_item` to route the webhook to the flow.
5. **Test**: `dispatch` with a sample Twilio payload; verify trace.

**Gotchas:**
- The webhook surface spreads top-level payload fields into flow inputs — so `{{From}}`, `{{To}}`, `{{Body}}` work directly in templates without reaching into `payload.*`.
- Use `behavior.inputMapping` if Twilio's field names don't match what your steps expect (e.g. rename `Body` → `message`).

## Recipe 3: Scheduled news digest

**Shape**: Every weekday at 8am, scrape a list of sources, summarize what's new since the last run, store the summary as a record, email it.

**Steps:**

1. **Record types**:
   - `source` records (one per source URL, with metadata).
   - `digest` records (one per day's summary).
2. **Flow**: `create_flow`:
   - Step 1: `retrieve-record` with `recordFilter: { type: "source" }` — load all sources.
   - Step 2: `transform-data` — for each source, run an async fetch (a small `Promise.all` over `crawl` or `fetch-url` operations is OK, or split into a sub-flow if it gets messy).
   - Step 3: `prompt` — summarize new content; produce a structured digest object.
   - Step 4: `upsert-record` — store the digest as a `digest` record with today's date as `name`.
   - Step 5: `template` — render an HTML email from the digest.
   - Step 6: `send-email` — deliver to a configured recipient list.
3. **Schedule**: `create_schedule`:
   - `target: { type: "flow", flowId }`
   - `trigger`: cron `0 8 * * MON-FRI`
   - `input`: any flow-level input (e.g. recipient list)
4. **Test**: `run_schedule_now` for an immediate manual run. Check `list_schedule_runs` for status, `trace_execution` for any failures.

**Gotchas:**
- The fetch step can take a while. The execution engine handles long-running tasks but watch `get_log_stats` for time-outs.
- Email rendering — prefer `template` (Liquid) over generating HTML in a `prompt`. Determinism, cost, predictability.

## Recipe 4: Custom MCP server with tools for Cursor

**Shape**: Expose three custom tools (`lookup_design_token`, `search_components`, `generate_storybook_example`) over MCP so Cursor users can call them from their IDE.

**Steps:**

1. **Tools**:
   - `create_tool` for each of the three. Each is a custom JS tool that calls an internal API or vector store. Use `validate_code` before each create.
2. **Agent or flow capability**: create a capability that uses those tools. For an MCP surface, exposed tools are generated from bound capabilities; the `mcp` surface behavior config only covers server/auth/logging metadata.
3. **Product wiring**:
   - `create_product`.
   - `add_product_capability` for the agent or flow.
4. **Surface**: `create_surface` of type `mcp`.
5. **Surface item**: `add_surface_item` to bind the capability to the MCP surface. Each bound capability becomes an MCP tool.
6. **Surface key**: `create_surface_key` — the user's Cursor MCP config will need this key.
7. **Distribute**: Tell the user to add the MCP server to Cursor with the URL and key.

**Gotchas:**
- Tool descriptions are the LLM's interface — write them like docstrings, not like commit messages. The LLM will choose based on the description.
- For each tool, define `inputSchema` strictly. Loose schemas yield bad LLM tool calls.

## Recipe 5: Embeddable chat widget for a website

**Shape**: A support agent embedded on a marketing website with a custom theme.

**Steps:**

1. **Agent**: `create_agent` with the support persona and any tools it needs (FAQ search, ticket creation, etc.).
2. **Product** + capability binding.
3. **Surface**: `create_surface` of type `chat`. Configure the launcher, theme, and visible features (`showToolCalls`, `showReasoning`).
4. **Client token**: `create_client_token` — public, scoped, revocable, and usable by the browser-side widget.
5. **Embed code**: `generate_persona_embed_code` — returns a ready-to-paste HTML snippet. **Prefer this over hand-writing the embed.**
6. **Theming**: Before generating a custom theme, call `get_persona_theme_reference` to load the design-token docs and example themes. See `persona-widget.md` for the contrast rules and theming gotchas — header tokens are easy to get wrong.

**Gotchas:**
- Wrong package name (`@runtype/persona` vs `@runtypelabs/persona` — the latter is correct), wrong API (`Persona.mount()` doesn't exist — use `initAgentWidget()`), wrong CSS path are common errors. The MCP-generated embed code avoids all of these.
- For consumer-facing widgets, set `features.showToolCalls: false` and `features.showReasoning: false`. For internal debug surfaces, leave them on.

## Recipe 6: Eval harness for an agent change

**Shape**: You changed the system prompt; you want to know whether quality improved.

**Steps:**

1. **Records**: create a record set of inputs — one record per test case, with the expected outcome in metadata.
2. **Submit eval**: `submit_eval` — point at the agent's previous version AND the new version, over the record set.
3. **Compare**:
   - `get_eval_results` for raw outputs.
   - `compare_eval` for side-by-side across versions.
   - `compare_eval_record` to drill into specific records that diverged.
   - `analyze_eval_steps` for step-level performance (useful if the agent is multi-step).
4. **Iterate** or `publish_agent_version` if results are better.

**Gotchas:**
- Don't ship a non-trivial prompt change without an eval. It's faster than rollback.
- Cost: evals across many records can run up cost; check `get_batch_cost` mid-run.

## Recipe 7: Multi-agent system

**Shape**: A product with an orchestrator that delegates to a research agent and a writing agent.

Three viable patterns. Pick by where the routing decision lives.

**Pattern A: Auto-orchestrator (Runtype-managed)** — preferred when each sub-agent is independently useful

- Build each sub-agent independently. Each is its own agent with its own tools.
- Add all sub-agents as capabilities of the product.
- Bind all of them to the same conversational surface.
- **Runtype auto-provisions an orchestrator agent** that routes incoming messages to the right sub-agent.
- See Recipe 8 for the orchestrator-eval workflow.

This is the default choice for multi-agent products. The platform handles the routing.

**Pattern B: Sub-agents as tools** — preferred when one agent should be primary and others assist

- A primary agent has tools that wrap the sub-agents (each tool calls `execute_agent` on a sub-agent).
- The primary agent decides at each turn which sub-agent to invoke.
- Useful when the primary is the user-facing personality and the sub-agents are "advisors."

**Pattern C: Flow with `execute-agent` steps** — preferred when orchestration is deterministic

- A flow with a known sequence: research → write → review.
- Each step is `execute-agent` against a sub-agent.
- The flow is the orchestrator, not an LLM.

Choose A if multiple capabilities should be exposed to users via the same surface. Choose B if one agent is dominant. Choose C if the next step is always the same.

**Gotchas:**
- Pattern A: routing should be fast. If the orchestrator is slow, override to a smaller model or tune the system prompt.
- Pattern B risks unbounded loops. Cap with `maxToolCalls`. Sub-agents should not call back into the orchestrator (no recursion).
- Pattern C: less flexible but most predictable. Cost-effective for known workflows.

## When to package as an FPO Template

If the user is building something they want others to instantiate (e.g. a McKenzieMax-style consulting product, a CollectiveX RAG starter, a SeedScout monitoring agent), package it as an FPO Template.

- Define `template.variables` for things importers fill in (model preference, webhook URLs, recipient lists, etc.).
- For secrets, use the pending-secret pattern: declare on tool `auth.secrets`, reference in tool config with `{{secret:KEY}}` (singular). On import, the platform creates `needs_configuration` bindings and prompts the user — secrets never live in the FPO file.
- See `fpo-templates.md` for the TypeScript types and validation.

The result is a single distributable JSON document someone else can import in one click.

## Recipe 8: Multi-capability product with auto-orchestrator

**Shape**: A web chat that exposes three agents — sales, support, billing — and routes user messages automatically.

**Steps**:

1. Build three agents independently: `sales_agent`, `support_agent`, `billing_agent`. Each has its own system prompt and tool set.
2. `create_product` to group them.
3. `add_product_capability` three times — one per agent.
4. `create_surface` of type `chat`.
5. `add_surface_item` three times — wiring each capability into the same surface.
6. **Runtype auto-provisions an orchestrator** because multiple capabilities are bound to the same conversational surface.
7. Test the routing: send messages that obviously belong to each capability and verify they reach the right agent. `trace_conversation` shows the orchestrator's routing decisions.
8. **Run a product eval on the orchestrator** before launch — submit a record set of messages with expected routing, compare strategies.

**When to override the orchestrator default**: only if routing is slow (>1s) or wrong. The default uses an inexpensive model with minimum data over the wire. Customize the orchestrator's system prompt with domain hints if routing is borderline:

> "Sales-related questions (pricing, demos, plans): route to A. Support questions (broken features, how-to): route to B. Billing questions (invoices, refunds): route to C. When ambiguous, prefer B."

## Recipe 9: Federate an external CrewAI agent into a Runtype product

**Shape**: You have an existing CrewAI agent that does goal-oriented research really well. You want to deploy it as part of a Runtype product (so you get Slack/email/web chat delivery for free) without rewriting.

**Steps**:

1. Expose your CrewAI agent over the **A2A protocol**. Most agent frameworks have A2A adapters or you can write a small wrapper.
2. In Runtype, `create_integration` for the external agent and register its skills.
3. The external agent now appears as a **capability** in your Runtype product, alongside any native Runtype agents.
4. `add_product_capability` to bind it.
5. `add_surface_item` to wire it into whatever surfaces you want (Slack, email, web chat).
6. The Runtype execution engine routes traffic to the external agent when its capability is selected.

**Notes**:
- Streaming may be reduced compared to native Runtype agents — A2A standard supports basic streaming but loses some Runtype-specific features (artifact generation, certain UI tools).
- Same product can mix native Runtype agents, Runtype flows, A2A agents, and cloud-managed agents.
- Pattern of choice for: incremental migration into Runtype, using specialized frameworks for sub-tasks, or treating Runtype as a "surface delivery layer" for agents built elsewhere.

## Recipe 10: SDK-defined product with local tools (browser DOM access)

**Shape**: An AI assistant embedded on a SaaS app. The agent should be able to read what's on the current page and trigger front-end actions (open a modal, navigate to a record, fill a form) — operations that don't have server-side APIs.

**Steps**:

1. Install `@runtypelabs/persona` and the Runtype SDK in the front-end app.
2. Define the agent in SDK code:
   ```ts
   const agent = defineAgent({
     name: "page_assistant",
     systemPrompt: "...",
     tools: [
       defineLocalTool({
         name: "read_page_html",
         description: "Read the HTML of the current page",
         async execute() {
           return document.documentElement.outerHTML;
         }
       }),
       defineLocalTool({
         name: "navigate_to_record",
         description: "Open the record detail view for a given record id",
         parameters: { recordId: { type: "string", description: "..." } },
         async execute({ recordId }) {
           router.push(`/records/${recordId}`);
         }
       }),
     ],
   });
   ```
3. Pick a mode: stored, upsert-on-execute, or virtual.
4. Wire the SDK to a Persona widget on the page — when the LLM calls these tools, the SDK on the page executes them in the browser; the result goes back through Runtype to the LLM.

**Why this matters**: the LLM gets real agency over the front-end without needing a server-side bridge for every operation. Pair with **hidden parameters** if any tool also needs authenticated context — the LLM doesn't see the auth token, but the local tool fills it from the page's session.

---

## Recipe 11: Privacy-sensitive product with hidden parameters + server-side local tools

**Shape**: An agent that answers questions about a user's personal medical records. The LLM should never see the records directly — only summarized, redacted views.

**Steps**:

1. In your server code (Python or TS SDK), define the agent.
2. Define tools as **server-side local tools** — they run on your server, not in Runtype.
3. For each tool, mark the user-context parameters as **hidden** (`user_id`, `tenant_id`, `session_token`).
4. The LLM sees something like `get_summary(question)` — no auth, no user id.
5. Your server-side tool implementation, when invoked, fills in `user_id` from request context, queries your records database, returns a redacted summary string.
6. The LLM never receives raw records — only the summary string from the tool's return.
7. Optional: deploy the whole thing **on-prem** if the customer also requires that data never leaves their infrastructure.

**This is the current best practice for LLM products on sensitive data.** Hidden parameters + local tools + (optionally) on-prem deployment together cover the security surface most enterprises ask about.

## When to use which deployment mode

A quick cross-reference:

| Need | Mode |
|---|---|
| Ship fast, no team requirements | Hosted on a surface |
| Source of truth in Git | SDK upsert mode |
| Per-tenant agent customization | SDK virtual flows |
| Browser-side tool access | SDK + local tools |
| LLM-orchestrates-but-doesn't-see-data | Hidden parameters + local tools |
| Customer requires data residency | On-prem (enterprise) |
| Mix Runtype + external agent framework | A2A federation |

See `working-modes.md` for the full discussion.
