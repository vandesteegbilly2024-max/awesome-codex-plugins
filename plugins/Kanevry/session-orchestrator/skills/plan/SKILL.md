  Use this skill when performing structured project planning and PRD generation with three modes:
  new (project kickoff with repo scaffolding), feature (compact feature PRD),
  retro (data-driven retrospective). All modes share a researched Q&A engine
  that dispatches parallel Explore agents before each question wave, presents
  options via AskUserQuestion with recommendations, and produces documents
  with prioritized issue creation.

# Plan Skill

> Project-instruction file resolution: CLAUDE.md and AGENTS.md (Codex CLI) are transparent aliases — see [skills/_shared/instruction-file-resolution.md](../_shared/instruction-file-resolution.md). All references below to `CLAUDE.md` resolve via that precedence rule.

## File Structure

- `SKILL.md` — Core framework: mode router, Q&A engine, shared phases
- `mode-new.md` — Project kickoff: 3 Q&A waves, PRD template, repo scaffolding
- `mode-feature.md` — Feature PRD: 2 Q&A waves, compact scope, acceptance criteria
- `mode-retro.md` — Retrospective: metrics analysis, reflection waves, improvement actions
- `soul.md` — Product Strategist identity and behavioral anchor

## Soul Reference

Before anything else, read and internalize `soul.md` in this skill directory. It defines WHO you are — a Product Strategist who drives planning outcomes through structured research and decisive recommendations. Every interaction in this skill should reflect this identity. You are not a generic assistant; you are an opinionated product leader who backs every recommendation with data.

## Phase 0: Bootstrap Gate

Read `skills/_shared/bootstrap-gate.md` and execute the gate check. If the gate is CLOSED, invoke `skills/bootstrap/SKILL.md` and wait for completion before proceeding. If the gate is OPEN, continue to Phase 1.

<HARD-GATE>
Do NOT proceed past Phase 0 if GATE_CLOSED. There is no bypass. Refer to `skills/_shared/bootstrap-gate.md` for the full HARD-GATE constraints.
</HARD-GATE>

## Phase 1: Read Session Config

Read and parse Session Config per `skills/_shared/config-reading.md`. Store result as `$CONFIG`.

After parsing, verify that `plan-baseline-path` is not null: `echo "$CONFIG" | jq -e '."plan-baseline-path"'`. If null, stop with: "Error: `plan-baseline-path` is not configured in Session Config. Add it to your CLAUDE.md (or AGENTS.md on Codex CLI) under `## Session Config`. Example: `plan-baseline-path: ~/Projects/projects-baseline`"

Plan-specific fields (also parse these): `plan-default-visibility`, `plan-prd-location`, `plan-retro-location`, `vcs`

Store all values for use in subsequent phases.

**Path expansion:** Expand `~` to `$HOME` in `plan-baseline-path`, `plan-prd-location`, and `plan-retro-location`. Verify expanded paths exist. If `plan-baseline-path` doesn't exist, warn: "Baseline path not found at [path]. `/plan new` repo scaffolding will be unavailable."

If no `## Session Config` section exists at all, stop and report: "Error: No Session Config section found in CLAUDE.md (or AGENTS.md on Codex CLI). The `/plan` skill requires at minimum `plan-baseline-path` to be configured."

> **Platform Note:** This skill uses `AskUserQuestion` extensively. On Codex CLI where this tool is unavailable, present all choices as numbered Markdown lists with "(Recommended)" on the first option. The user responds with their choice number. See `skills/_shared/platform-tools.md`.

> On Codex CLI, Explore agents map to the `explorer` agent role. See `skills/_shared/platform-tools.md`.

## Phase 2: Mode Router

> **Ambiguous scope?** If the feature's UX/scope is still ambiguous before starting, run `/brainstorm` first (see `skills/brainstorm/SKILL.md`) to produce a design spec, then return here with the spec as input. `/brainstorm` outputs `docs/specs/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>-design.md`.

Parse `$ARGUMENTS` to determine the planning mode:

- **`new`** — Read `mode-new.md` in this skill directory for mode-specific instructions. This mode handles full project kickoff: requirement gathering, PRD generation, repo scaffolding, and issue creation.
- **`feature`** — Read `mode-feature.md` in this skill directory for mode-specific instructions. This mode handles feature-level PRDs with compact scope and acceptance criteria.
- **`retro`** — Read `mode-retro.md` in this skill directory for mode-specific instructions. This mode handles data-driven retrospectives with metrics analysis and improvement actions.

If `$ARGUMENTS` is empty or does not match any mode, use AskUserQuestion to ask:

```
AskUserQuestion({
  questions: [{
    question: "Which planning mode do you want to run?",
    header: "Plan Mode",
    options: [
      { label: "new", description: "Project kickoff — full PRD, repo setup, issue creation. Use when starting a brand new project." },
      { label: "feature", description: "Feature PRD — compact scope, acceptance criteria, issues. Use when adding a feature to an existing project." },
      { label: "retro", description: "Retrospective — metrics analysis, reflection, improvement actions. Use after completing a project phase or sprint." }
    ],
    multiSelect: false
  }]
})
```

After mode selection, proceed to Phase 3 with the chosen mode.

## Phase 3: Q&A Engine (Shared Core)

This is the distinctive mechanic shared by all three modes. Every question wave follows the same pattern: research first, then ask.

### 3.1 Pre-Question Research

Before each Q&A wave, dispatch 2-3 `Agent()` tool calls in a single message (parallel execution) with `subagent_type: "Explore"`:

1. **Market/online context agent** — searches for relevant market data, best practices, competitor analysis, or technical patterns depending on the questions to be asked. Tools: WebSearch, WebFetch.
2. **Baseline analysis agent** — reads projects-baseline templates, rules, and scripts at `$BASELINE_PATH` to discover available options (archetypes, styles, configurations). Tools: Read, Glob, Grep.
3. **Repo context agent** (skip for `/plan new` wave 1) — analyzes the current repository for existing patterns, file structure, dependencies, and conventions. Tools: Read, Glob, Grep.

Example dispatch:

```
Agent({ subagent_type: "Explore", description: "Research market context for [topic]",
  prompt: "Search online for [topic]. Report findings with pros/cons for each option." })
Agent({ subagent_type: "Explore", description: "Analyze baseline templates",
  prompt: "Read projects-baseline at $BASELINE_PATH/templates/. List available archetypes, their README descriptions, and key features." })
Agent({ subagent_type: "Explore", description: "Analyze repo context",
  prompt: "Explore current repo for [relevant patterns]. Report affected files and existing conventions." })
```

Wait for ALL agents to complete before proceeding. Use `run_in_background: false` for all agents.

### 3.2 Question Presentation

Synthesize research results into 5 questions per wave. Split across 2 AskUserQuestion calls (3+2 or 4+1) to stay within the 4-question-per-call limit.

**Option format rules:**
- Option 1 is ALWAYS the recommendation, marked with `(Recommended)` in the label
- Each option includes a `description` with Pros/Cons drawn from the research
- Include an "Other" option when custom input makes sense
- Use `multiSelect: false` unless the question genuinely requires multiple selections

Example payload:

```
AskUserQuestion({ questions: [
  { question: "Which project archetype fits best?", header: "Archetype", options: [
    { label: "nextjs-saas (Recommended)", description: "Pro: Full SaaS stack with auth, payments. Con: Heavier initial setup." },
    { label: "express-service", description: "Pro: Lightweight API. Con: No frontend." },
    { label: "docker-service", description: "Pro: Maximum flexibility. Con: More manual setup." },
    { label: "Other", description: "Describe your preferred archetype." }
  ], multiSelect: false },
  { question: "Which visibility tier?", header: "Visibility", options: [
    { label: "internal (Recommended)", description: "Pro: GitLab private, team access. Con: No external visibility." },
    { label: "private", description: "Pro: + optional GitHub mirror. Con: Limited collaboration." },
    { label: "public/OSS", description: "Pro: Open source, GitHub public + license. Con: Requires careful secret management." }
  ], multiSelect: false },
  { question: "Who is the target audience?", header: "Audience", options: [
    { label: "Internal team (Recommended)", description: "Pro: Controlled rollout. Con: Limited feedback pool." },
    { label: "B2B customers", description: "Pro: Revenue potential. Con: Higher quality bar." },
    { label: "Public/developers", description: "Pro: Community contributions. Con: Support burden." },
    { label: "Other", description: "Describe your target audience." }
  ], multiSelect: false }
]})
```

### 3.3 Adaptive Depth

Each mode defines a starting wave count:
- `/plan new` — start with 3 waves minimum
- `/plan feature` — start with 1 wave minimum
- `/plan retro` — start with 1 wave minimum

Maximum across all modes: 5 waves.

After each wave, assess whether to continue:
- **Answers are clear and unambiguous** — all key decisions made, no open questions remain. Stop Q&A, proceed to Phase 4.
- **Answers reveal complexity** — multiple subsystems, unclear requirements, conflicting constraints, or new concerns surfaced. Add another wave with targeted follow-up questions.
- **User aborts early** — if the user says "Enough questions, generate the PRD" or similar, proceed directly to Phase 4 with the answers gathered so far.

### 3.4 Answer Tracking

Maintain a running summary of all answers across waves. After each wave, output a brief recap:

```
## Answers So Far (Wave N/M)
1. Archetype: nextjs-saas
2. Visibility: internal
3. Audience: B2B customers
4. ...
```

This ensures transparency and allows the user to correct any misunderstanding before the next wave.

## Phase 4: Document Generation

After Q&A completes, generate the output document.

### 4.1 Read Template

Select the template based on mode:
- `/plan new` — read `prd-full-template.md` in this skill directory (8-section full PRD)
- `/plan feature` — read `prd-feature-template.md` in this skill directory (5-section compact PRD)
- `/plan retro` — read `retro-template.md` in this skill directory (retrospective document)

### 4.2 Fill Template

Fill every template section with gathered answers. Use the research agent outputs to enrich sections beyond what the user explicitly stated — add technical details, risk analysis, and architecture sketches derived from the baseline and repo analysis.

Do NOT leave any section with TBD, placeholder, or empty content. If a section cannot be filled from gathered data, make a best-effort recommendation and mark it with `<!-- REVIEW: inferred from research, confirm with stakeholders -->`.

### 4.3 Save Document

Write the document to the configured location:
- PRDs → `{plan-prd-location}/YYYY-MM-DD-{project-or-feature-name}.md`
- Retros → `{plan-retro-location}/YYYY-MM-DD-retro.md`

Use today's date. Derive the name slug from the project name (for new) or feature name (for feature) — lowercase, hyphens, no special characters.

Ensure the target directory exists (create with `mkdir -p` if needed) before writing.

## Phase 3.5: Package Legitimacy Audit (Slopcheck — #520)

> Despite the name, this phase runs *after* Phase 4 (Document Generation) and *before* Phase 5 (PRD Review). The "3.5" identifier is historical, anchored to the PRD's Pattern-2 specification so cross-references stay searchable.

> Skip this phase if `slopcheck.enabled: false` in Session Config (default).

After the PRD is generated, scan the PRD body for package mentions and run
`classifyPackages()` from `scripts/lib/slopcheck.mjs` against them.

### Detection

Look for these patterns in the PRD body:
- npm: code-fenced blocks with `pnpm add`, `npm install`, `npm i`, or
  bare package names in `## Dependencies` / `## Affected Files` sections
- pip: `pip install`, `requirements.txt` references
- cargo: `cargo add`, `Cargo.toml` deps section

Extract package names + registry tuples: `[{name: 'react', registry: 'npm'}, ...]`.

### Dispatch

```javascript
import { classifyPackages } from '../../scripts/lib/slopcheck.mjs';
const results = await classifyPackages(detectedPackages);
```

### Handling per classification

- **LEGITIMATE**: no action, continue.
- **ASSUMED**: append "Package Legitimacy Audit" section to PRD body with the
  ASSUMED list. No user interaction required. Operator can review before close.
- **SUS**: AskUserQuestion: "Package <name> has audit warning: <evidence>.
  Continue anyway, replace, or remove?"
- **SLOP**: AskUserQuestion (BLOCKING): "Package <name> not found in <registry>
  registry. Possible LLM hallucination. Options: abort plan, correct name,
  mark as experimental in PRD body."

### Fail-Soft

If `classifyPackages` returns `{classification: 'ASSUMED', evidence: 'registry-timeout'}`
or `'cache-error'`, treat as ASSUMED + log to stderr. Never block plan
generation due to slopcheck failure — log + continue.

### Skip Conditions

- `slopcheck.enabled: false` in Session Config (default)
- PRD contains no package mentions
- `slopcheck.sources` does not include `plan` (e.g., set to `[discovery]` only)

## Phase 5: PRD Review (skip for retro mode)

### 5.1 Dispatch Reviewer

Dispatch a reviewer subagent: read `prd-reviewer-prompt.md` in this skill directory for review instructions. Pass the full PRD content to the reviewer.

The reviewer checks 6 criteria:
1. **Completeness** — all sections filled, no TBD or placeholder content
2. **Consistency** — no internal contradictions between sections
3. **Clarity** — unambiguous enough that a developer could implement from this document alone
4. **Scope** — focused on one project/feature, not sprawling across multiple subsystems
5. **YAGNI** — no unrequested features or gold-plating
6. **SMART metrics** — success criteria are Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound

### 5.2 Revision Loop

If any criterion is FAIL:
1. Read the reviewer's feedback
2. Revise the affected PRD sections
3. Re-submit to the reviewer

Maximum 3 iterations. After 3 iterations with remaining issues, present them to the user via AskUserQuestion:

```
AskUserQuestion({
  questions: [{
    question: "The PRD reviewer flagged these remaining issues after 3 revision rounds:\n\n[list issues]\n\nHow do you want to proceed?",
    header: "PRD Review",
    options: [
      { label: "Accept as-is (Recommended)", description: "Issues are minor, proceed with current PRD." },
      { label: "Manual edit", description: "I'll edit the PRD myself before continuing." },
      { label: "Re-run review", description: "Try one more revision round." }
    ],
    multiSelect: false
  }]
})
```

### 5.3 User Review Gate

After the reviewer passes (or user accepts), present the final PRD:

```
AskUserQuestion({
  questions: [{
    question: "PRD is ready for your review. It has been saved to [path].\n\nPlease review the document and confirm.",
    header: "PRD Approval",
    options: [
      { label: "Approve PRD (Recommended)", description: "PRD looks good, proceed to issue creation." },
      { label: "Request changes", description: "I have feedback — let me describe what to change." }
    ],
    multiSelect: false
  }]
})
```

If user requests changes, apply them, save the updated document, and re-present for approval. No limit on user-requested revisions.

## Phase 6: Issue Creation (all modes)

### 6.1 Derive Issue Structure

Determine Epic and sub-issues based on mode:
- **`/plan new`** — derive from PRD Section 4 (Solution & Scope). Each major scope item becomes a sub-issue. Group under an Epic named after the project.
- **`/plan feature`** — derive from PRD Section 3 (Acceptance Criteria). Each Given/When/Then block becomes a sub-issue. Group under an Epic named after the feature.
- **`/plan retro`** — derive from the improvement actions in the reflection phase. Each action becomes an issue (no Epic wrapper unless 5+ actions).

### 6.2 Auto-Prioritize

Score each issue using three factors:

1. **Technical dependencies (highest weight):** Issues that other issues depend on get `priority:critical` or `priority:high`. Identify dependency chains: DB schema before API, API before frontend, shared libs before consumers, infrastructure before application.

2. **Business value (medium weight):** Issues the user marked as core MVP features in the PRD get `priority:high`. Nice-to-haves and polish items get `priority:medium` or `priority:low`.

3. **Risk (tiebreaker):** Issues with identified risks, unknowns, or external dependencies get bumped up one priority level.

Assign labels from the standard taxonomy:
- `priority:critical` / `priority:high` / `priority:medium` / `priority:low`
- `type:feature` / `type:enhancement` / `type:bug` / `type:chore` / `type:discovery`
- `status:ready`
- `area:<inferred from content>` (e.g., `area:api`, `area:frontend`, `area:infra`)
- For `/plan new`: add `appetite:<1w|2w|6w>` and `mvp-phase` labels where applicable

### 6.3 User Review

Present the full issue structure via AskUserQuestion before creating anything:

```
AskUserQuestion({
  questions: [{
    question: "Proposed issue structure:\n\n**Epic:** [title]\n\n| # | Sub-Issue | Priority | Labels | Blocked By |\n|---|----------|----------|--------|------------|\n| 1 | [title]  | critical | [labels] | — |\n| 2 | [title]  | high     | [labels] | #1 |\n| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |\n\nTotal: [N] issues. Confirm or adjust.",
    header: "Issue Review",
    options: [
      { label: "Create all issues (Recommended)", description: "Proceed with the proposed structure." },
      { label: "Adjust priorities", description: "I want to change some priorities before creating." },
      { label: "Remove issues", description: "Some issues should not be created." },
      { label: "Cancel", description: "Do not create any issues." }
    ],
    multiSelect: false
  }]
})
```

If user selects "Adjust priorities" or "Remove issues", handle the adjustments interactively and re-present.

### 6.4 Create Issues

> **VCS Reference:** Detect the VCS platform per the "VCS Auto-Detection" section of the gitlab-ops skill. Use CLI commands per the "Common CLI Commands" section.

For each approved issue:

1. Create via VCS CLI using comma-separated labels in a single `--label` flag:
   - **GitLab**: `glab issue create --title "[Plan] <title>" --label "type:feature,priority:high,status:ready" --description "<body>"`
   - **GitHub**: `gh issue create --title "[Plan] <title>" --label "type:feature,priority:high,status:ready" --body "<body>"`
2. Brief pause (1s) between creations for rate limiting
3. After all issues are created, set dependency links:
   - **GitLab**: use `glab api` to set `blocks`/`is-blocked-by` relations
   - **GitHub**: note dependencies in issue body (GitHub lacks native blocking)

### 6.5 Final Report

```
## Plan Complete

### Document
- [PRD/Retro] saved to: [path]
- Review status: [approved / accepted with notes]

### Issues Created
| # | Title | Priority | Labels | Blocks |
|---|-------|----------|--------|--------|
| <IID> | <title> | <priority> | <labels> | <blocked issues> |

### Dependencies
[Dependency graph as text: #1 → #2 → #4, #1 → #3, #5 (independent)]

### Next Steps
- [Contextual recommendations based on mode]
```

For `/plan new`, next steps include: "Run `/session feature` in the new repo to begin implementation."
For `/plan feature`, next steps include: "Run `/session feature` to implement this PRD."
For `/plan retro`, next steps include: "Address improvement issues in your next session."

## Critical Rules

- **NEVER skip the Q&A phase** — even if the user provides a detailed brief, validate through structured questions. The Q&A surfaces blind spots.
- **NEVER assume projects-baseline templates** — always read from the configured `plan-baseline-path`. Templates change; hardcoded assumptions break.
- **ALWAYS research before asking** — dispatch Explore agents before every Q&A wave. Questions without research backing are guesses.
- **ALWAYS mark Option 1 as recommended** — with `(Recommended)` in the label. Every question must have a clear recommendation.
- **ALWAYS use AskUserQuestion** — never present options as plain text. The structured UI is mandatory.
- **ALWAYS save documents before creating issues** — the PRD/retro document is the source of truth. Issues reference it.
- **Security** — never include internal paths, IPs, or infrastructure details in output documents. Read sensitive baseline areas for context but filter from outputs.
- **Idempotency** — if the user re-runs `/plan` with the same mode, check for an existing PRD at the target location. If found, use AskUserQuestion to offer: "Update existing PRD" vs. "Create new version" vs. "Cancel".
