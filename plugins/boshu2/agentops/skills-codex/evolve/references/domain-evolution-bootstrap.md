# Domain Evolution Bootstrap

Use this reference when `$evolve` is asked to reshape AgentOps skills, CLI,
hooks, docs, tests, beads, or knowledge as one software-factory system.

## Product Frame

AgentOps is the SDLC control plane and context compiler for LLM agents. The
narrow waist is BDD/Gherkin, DDD, Hexagonal architecture, TDD, XP, and
CI/SRE/ADRs/provenance.

Do not treat a skill, hook, or command as valuable by itself. It is valuable
only when it advances the factory loop: intent, boundary, proof, evidence, and
compounding context.

## Bootstrap Sequence

1. Read current direction from `PRODUCT.md`, `GOALS.md`, `docs/cdlc.md`, and
   `docs/architecture/operating-loop.md`.
2. Validate the durable control artifacts:

   ```bash
   bash scripts/check-agentops-domain-evolution-plan.sh
   ```

3. Select one domain and one vertical slice from the domain evolution docs.
4. Use `$skill-builder` and `$skill-auditor` for skill changes. Use
   `skills-codex/skill-auditor/scripts/score_agentops_skill.py` to choose the
   smallest score-improving patch.
5. Keep CLI and hook changes behind typed ports or existing validation scripts.
6. Run focused validation before selecting the next slice.

## Hard Rules

- No broad rewrite before a Gherkin row, domain, and first proof are named.
- No third-party content copying; use clean-room structural observations only.
- No shipped skill deletion until replacement workflow and validation evidence
  exist.
- No shell-only read path when a typed port already exists.
- No unattended run from a dirty canonical root or stale installed `ao` binary.
